Chaldron Protocol

Seamlessly move tokens from one chain to another

The Chaldron protocol creates a decentralized bridge for tokens between blockchains, initially operating on EVM chains with plans to expand to other networks. The protocol uses a simple burn-and-mint mechanism that eliminates the need for liquidity pools, third-party services, or complex lock mechanisms.


🌟 Features

✅ No Liquidity Required - Burn and mint mechanism
✅ Owner-Controlled - Only token owners can register and control their tokens
✅ Multi-Chain Support - Bridge across multiple EVM networks
✅ Decentralized Security - Powered by Axelar Network

🚀 How It Works

Burn tokens on the source chain
Decentralized Oracles Networks handles secure cross-chain messaging
Mint equivalent tokens on the destination chain
